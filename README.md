#Deep Learning—Auto-tag Images of the Gala

Catagorical Image recognition using deep learning models:

CNN Model with Regularization
CNN Model with Image Augmentation
Leveraging Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNN Models
VGG-16 model
Pre-trained CNN model as a Feature Extractor with Image Augmentation

The 'Auto-tag Images of the Gala' data consists of 11000 32x32 color images in 4 classes. There are 6000 training images and 5000 test images in the data.

The label classes in the dataset are:
1. Food 
2. misc 
3. Attire
4. Decorationandsignage

Deep Learning Problem:

1. Detect and recognise the objects/images from the data set with optimum accuracy.
2. Accuracy should be considerably higher.
3. There is no time constraint.

Steps followed to solve the problem:
1. Load and pre-process the data
2. Define the model’s architecture
3. Train the model
4. Make predictions
